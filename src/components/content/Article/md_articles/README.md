# Code Stumble

>*If you're not lost, you're not exploring*

Code Stumble will eventually be a blog thats sole purpose is to teach people
anything that falls under the umbrella term *Computer Programming*.

I'm hoping what will set it apart is my inclusion of the many __MANY__ pitfalls
I fall in while I'm learning whichever topic I'm on. This site will demonstrate my
path from an idea, the learning, the trying, the failing, the fixing, and the incorporation.
