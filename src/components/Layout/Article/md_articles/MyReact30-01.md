Site I found how to add Typescript:
  https://facebook.github.io/craeate-react-app/docs/adding-typescript

Copy over HTML, audio, and CSS

Change class to className
import CSS file
Bring over audio samples of drums

Desconstruct the JSX into smaller components.
Each variable inside of them includes:
  (One Class)
```jsx
  <div data-key="65" className="key">
    <kbd>A</kbd>
    <span className="sound">clap</span>
  </div>
  
  ```

Maybe make an index.js file for the audio sounds to be able to import them as a whole in the App to be able to pass them as props. OR import each sound {like, this, sample}.


experiment with adding event listeners to change the class of a particular piece.
