## If you're here to learn: 
 You can read all about either a task I undertook and how I failed along the way or about a topic I'm trying to explain to newer coders. You can also see the demos of a specific article in our Demos section.

## If you're an employer coming here to learn about me

You can head over to the About me section which has both a brief bio and a series of projects that demonstrate my abilities.

If you have any questions at all, feel free to email me @ _____
